# Progress

## What Works
- âœ… Basic node structure and integration with n8n
- âœ… Authentication with AITable API via token
- âœ… Get Node Details operation
- âœ… Get Node List operation
- âœ… Search Nodes operation
- âœ… Support for different node types (datasheet, folder, form, dashboard, mirror)
- âœ… Error handling for common failure scenarios
- âœ… Documentation in README.md
- âœ… Package publication to npm

## In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced error handling with more specific messages

## Known Issues
- The node may encounter rate limiting with large AITable instances
- Error messages could be more specific in some edge cases
- Limited handling of complex data types in AITable
- No automated tests implemented yet
