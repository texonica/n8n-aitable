# Progress

## What Works
- âœ… Basic node structure and integration with n8n
- âœ… Authentication with AITable API via token
- âœ… Get Node Details operation (via Search Nodes)
- âœ… Get Node List operation (via Search Nodes with filtering)
- âœ… Search Nodes operation for finding nodes in a space
- âœ… Search Records in Datasheet operation for querying data
- âœ… Create Record operation for adding data to datasheets
- âœ… Edit Record operation for updating existing data
- âœ… Delete Record operation for removing records
- âœ… Support for different node types (datasheet, folder, form, dashboard, mirror)
- âœ… Support for all field types including text, number, select, multi-select, date, and linked records
- âœ… Error handling for common failure scenarios
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation in README.md
- âœ… Package publication to npm

## In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- ðŸ”„ Documentation improvements with more complex workflow examples
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimizations for large datasets

## To Do
- â¬œ Add support for batch operations
- â¬œ Implement webhooks to react to AITable changes
- â¬œ Improve pagination for very large datasets
- â¬œ Add support for more advanced filtering options
- â¬œ Create automated tests
- â¬œ Support for custom UI components
- â¬œ Extended support for AITable's collaborative features

## Known Issues
- The node may encounter rate limiting with large AITable instances
- Error messages could be more descriptive for certain API errors
- Limited handling of very complex data relationships
- No automated tests implemented yet
