# Project Brief: n8n-aitable

## Overview
n8n-aitable is a community node for n8n that provides integration with AITable, allowing users to access and manipulate AITable data within n8n workflows. This node enables interaction with AITable's API to retrieve node details, list nodes, and search nodes across different types like datasheets, folders, forms, and dashboards.

## Core Objectives
1. Provide seamless integration between n8n and AITable
2. Enable workflow automation using AITable data
3. Support various AITable operations through a consistent interface
4. Maintain compatibility with n8n v1.0+ and AITable API v1

## Key Features
- Get Node Details: Retrieve information about specific AITable nodes
- Get Node List: Retrieve lists of nodes with filtering capabilities
- Search Nodes: Find nodes based on specific criteria
- Support for different node types (datasheets, folders, forms, dashboards, mirrors)

## Scope
- Create and maintain a reliable n8n community node
- Implement core AITable API functionalities
- Provide documentation and usage examples
- Support npm installation and manual installation through n8n interface

## Success Criteria
- Node functions correctly with AITable API
- All core operations work as documented
- Follows n8n community node standards
- Properly handles authentication and error cases
- Provides clear feedback on operation results
