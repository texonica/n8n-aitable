# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in a more developed state than initially described. The core functionality for interacting with AITable is implemented, and the node now supports both read and write operations, providing a comprehensive integration with AITable.

## Recent Changes
- Package name is "n8n-nodes-aitable-unofficial" to clarify community status
- Current version is 0.1.6 with icon improvements and optimizations
- Documentation enhanced in README.md with detailed usage examples
- Support for all node types implemented (datasheets, folders, forms, dashboards, mirrors)

## Active Decisions

### API Coverage
- The node now supports both read operations (retrieving data) and write operations (creating/updating/deleting data)
- The following operations are implemented:
  - Search Nodes: Find nodes (datasheets, folders, forms, dashboards) in a space
  - Search Records in Datasheet: Search and retrieve records from a specific datasheet
  - Create Record: Create new records in datasheets
  - Edit Record: Update existing records in datasheets
  - Delete Record: Remove records from datasheets

### User Experience
- Node configuration UI includes specific options for each operation type
- Error handling provides detailed feedback on API interaction issues
- Documentation includes examples for all supported operations

### Technical Direction
- Maintaining compatibility with the latest n8n versions (compatible with n8n v1.0+)
- Aligned with AITable API v1
- Support for all field types including linked records

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Enhance error handling for edge cases
2. Improve documentation with more complex workflow examples
3. Add support for batch operations to improve performance
4. Update dependencies to latest versions

### Medium Term
1. Implement webhooks support to react to AITable changes
2. Add support for AITable advanced filtering capabilities
3. Improve handling of large datasets with optimized pagination
4. Create automated tests for improved reliability

### Long Term
1. Support for AITable's collaborative features
2. Custom UI components for better configuration experience
3. Extended support for complex data relationships
4. Monitor for AITable API version changes and update accordingly
