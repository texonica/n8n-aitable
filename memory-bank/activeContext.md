# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in a maintenance and enhancement phase. The core functionality for interacting with AITable is implemented, but opportunities exist for expanding capabilities and improving user experience.

## Recent Changes
- Package name updated to "n8n-nodes-aitable-unofficial" to clarify community status
- Version bumped to 0.1.6 with minor fixes and improvements
- Documentation enhancements in README.md

## Active Decisions

### API Coverage
- The node currently focuses on read operations (retrieving data)
- Decision to be made about implementing write operations (creating/updating data)
- Considering adding support for advanced filtering and sorting capabilities

### User Experience
- Evaluating the node configuration UI for potential improvements
- Exploring options for better error handling and user feedback
- Considering enhanced documentation with more usage examples

### Technical Direction
- Maintaining compatibility with the latest n8n versions
- Staying aligned with AITable API updates
- Exploring options for handling large datasets efficiently

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Review and address any open issues
2. Consider adding support for additional node types

4. Improve documentation with additional examples

### Medium Term
1. Implement write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. Add support for webhooks to react to AITable changes
3. Improve handling of large datasets with pagination
4. Add more advanced filtering options

### Long Term
1. Comprehensive test suite for automated testing
2. Consider custom UI components for better configuration experience
3. Explore deeper integration with AITable's advanced features
4. Monitor for potential AITable API version changes
