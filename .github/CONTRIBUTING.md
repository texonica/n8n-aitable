# Contributing to n8n-nodes-aitable-unofficial

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this n8n community node as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the version number in `package.json` following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
3. The Pull Request will be merged once it's reviewed by a maintainer

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Build the node with `pnpm build`
4. For testing, you can use n8n's CLI commands to install the node locally

## Linting & Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality. Run `pnpm lint` before submitting your code.
